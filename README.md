# üèÜ &nbsp; Overview

This library includes a simplified interface for interacting with a v4 PoolTogether deployment. Create an instance of `PrizePoolNetwork` and use the initialized `PrizePool` and `PrizeDistributor` to begin reading and writing data to the protocol.

There are several classes that provide interfaces to the different aspects of the V4 PoolTogether protocol. `PrizePoolNetwork` is the main entry point.

- [PrizePoolNetwork](https://dev.pooltogether.com/protocol/libraries/v4-client-js/Classes/PrizePoolNetwork)
- [PrizePool](https://dev.pooltogether.com/protocol/libraries/v4-client-js/Classes/PrizePool)
- [User](https://dev.pooltogether.com/protocol/libraries/v4-client-js/Classes/User)
- [PrizeDistributor](https://dev.pooltogether.com/protocol/libraries/v4-client-js/Classes/PrizeDistributor)
- [DrawCalculatorApi](https://dev.pooltogether.com/protocol/libraries/v4-client-js/Classes/DrawCalculatorApi)
- [ContractFactory](https://dev.pooltogether.com/protocol/libraries/v4-client-js/Classes/ContractFactory)

## üíæ &nbsp; Installation

This project is available as an NPM package:

```sh
npm install @pooltogether/v4-client-js
```

or

```sh
yarn add @pooltogether/v4-client-js
```

The repo can be cloned from Github for contributions.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-client-js.git
```

## üèéÔ∏è &nbsp; Quickstart

### PrizePoolNetwork

A `PrizePoolNetwork` is a collection of `PrizePool` and `PrizeDistributor` across several chains that make up a v4 deployment.

To create an instance of `PrizePoolNetwork` you will need:

- A [Contract List](https://github.com/pooltogether/contract-list-schema) containing all of the relevant contracts for a v4 prize pool. You can obtain this by generating your own after deploying a v4 Prize Pool ([start here](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-core)). Or by importing a copy of our current deployments [v4-pool-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pooltogether/v4-pool-data).
- [Ethers providers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/) for every chain that a Prize Pool is deployed on.

```js
import { PrizePoolNetwork } from '@pooltogether/v4-client-js'
import { mainnet } from '@pooltogether/v4-pool-data'

const PrizePoolNetwork = new PrizePoolNetwork(providers, mainnet)
```

### PrizePool

A `PrizePool` is a representation of a Prize Pool deployment. The Prize Pool is responsible for managing deposits, withdrawals & delegation. `PrizePool` is a read only object, for write capabilities check out `User`

```js
const prizePool = PrizePoolNetwork.getPrizePool(1, '0xabc123')
```

### User

A `User` is wrapper around `PrizePool` with the ability to send transactions to manage deposits, withdrawals and delegation.

```js
const user = new User(prizePool.prizePoolMetadata, signer, prizePool)
```

### PrizeDistributor

A `PrizeDistributor` is what handles prizes. It is used to determine the current draw, check for prizes & claiming prizes. For write capabilities, pass a Signer when creating an instance.

```js
const prizeDistributor = PrizePoolNetwork.getPrizeDistributor(1, '0xabc123')
```

```js
const prizeDistributor = PrizePoolNetwork.getPrizeDistributor(1, '0xabc123')
const signer = provider.getSigner()
const signerPrizeDistributor = new PrizeDistributor(
  prizeDistributor.prizeDistributorMetadata,
  signer,
  prizeDistributor.contractMetadataList
)
```

## üßÆ &nbsp; Examples

### Get token data for a Prize Pool

```js
const tokenData = await prizePool.getTokenData() // Underlying token (ex. USDC)
const ticketData = await prizePool.getTicketData() // Ticket token
```

### Get a users deposit token & ticket balances

```js
const usersBalances: {
  chainId: number,
  address: string,
  balances: PrizePoolTokenBalances
}[] = await PrizePoolNetwork.getUsersPrizePoolBalances(usersAddress)
```

### Get a users deposit token & ticket balance

```js
const balance: PrizePoolTokenBalances = await prizePool.getUsersPrizePoolBalances(usersAddress)
```

### Approve deposits

NOTE: Make sure you're shifting by the proper decimal amount

```js
const txResponse: TransactionResponse = await user.approveDeposits(
  ethers.utils.parseUnits(10, decimals)
)
```

### Deposit and delegate tokens

NOTE: Make sure you're shifting by the proper decimal amount

```js
const txResponse: TransactionResponse = await user.depositAndDelegate(
  ethers.utils.parseUnits(10, decimals)
)
```

### Deposit tokens

NOTE: Make sure you're shifting by the proper decimal amount

```js
const txResponse: TransactionResponse = await user.deposit(ethers.utils.parseUnits(10, decimals))
```

### Withdraw tokens

NOTE: Make sure you're shifting by the proper decimal amount

```js
const txResponse: TransactionResponse = await user.withdraw(ethers.utils.parseUnits(10, decimals))
```

### Get available draw ids

Valid draw ids are draw ids that have all of the relevant data pushed to their respective chain & are not expired.

```js
const drawIds = await prizeDistributor.getAvailableDrawIds()
```

### Get a users prizes

```js
const drawResults = await PrizeApi.getUsersDrawResultsByDraw(
  chainId,
  usersAddress,
  prizeDistributorAddress,
  drawId,
  maxPicksPerUser
)
```

### Claim a users prizes

NOTE: Ensure the `PrizeDistributor` was initialized with a `Signer`

```js
const txResponse: TransactionResponse = await prizeDistributor.claimPrizesByDraw(1)
```

## üíª &nbsp; Developer Experience

### Contributing

[Create an Issue](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-utils-js/issues) to request new features.

[Open Pull Request](#) adhering to Contribution guidelines.

The package is setup using the [TSDX zero-config CLI](https://tsdx.io/) which includes:

- Typescript
- Rollup
- Jest
- Prettier
- ESLint

**Minor changes have been made to extend the default configuration.**

#### ESLint

The TSDX linting configuration is overwritten to include override(s)\* for:

- Import/Order (used to enforce consistent module import ordering)

###### \*The ESLint overrides may incorrectly be interpreted by VSCode since the nested config file is ignored in the IDE

### Porting docs to PoolTogether V4 Docs

1. `yarn docs`
2. Copy & paste

- `classes` to `Classes`
- `interfaces` to `Interfaces`
- `README.md` below header to `index.md`

3. Replace all `.md` with `` (nothing) in links
4. Replace all `README` links to `./` and `../README` to `../`
